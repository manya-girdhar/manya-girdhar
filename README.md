## Hi, I'm Manya
I am a second-year Artificial Intelligence student at The University of Manchester. I am also a moonshot thinker 🚀 and a proud woman in the tech industry 👩‍💻. I am working towards being a better software developer, a better leader and most importantly a better role model that would hopefully inspire others to go beyond their capabilities.✨ 

🔭 My current interests include Neural Networks, Project Management and Quantum Computing. 

#### ⚡ I am open for Summer Internships and Work Long Placements in 2021. Connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manya-girdhar/)
